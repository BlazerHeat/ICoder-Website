            <h2>What is iCoder?</h2>
            <p>iCoder is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.</p>

            <h2>Why should I solve challenges?</h2>
            <p>
                <em>For Fun.</em> What's more exciting than solving challenging problems? We're constantly adding helpful features to make our platform the best possible experience, such as boilerplate code and animations that display when you're running code.

            <h2>How do I write my code?</h2>
            <p>Each challenge page has an online editor embedded in the page for you to write and test your code in. If you're more comfortable coding in your favorite IDE, you can always upload your code to the challenge page when you're done!</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>How do I test and submit my code?</h2>
            <p>When you finish the first version of your code, click Run Code button to run your solution against one or more small sample test cases. Once you're confident your solution covers the entire problem, click Submit to run it against the entire set of test cases (or bots) and get a score for the challenge. Don't worry if you don't pass all the test cases, you can always rework your code and submit it again for an updated score. The score that shows up on the leaderboard will be the one for your top-scoring submission.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>What happens after I submit my code?</h2>
            <p>We run your code against hidden test cases. Depending on the output your code produced, you can get the following verdicts:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>Accepted.</em>
                <br/>Congratulations, your code passed all the test cases! It's time to solve a new challenge!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>Wrong Answer.</em>
                <br/>The output your code produced didn't match the output expected by the test case. Rethink your approach and think about whether you misunderstood the problem or missed a corner case.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>Terminated due to timeout.</em>
                <br/>Your code doesn't solve the problem efficiently enough! If you write a O(2n) solution when n = 100, it will surely time out and you're going to need to optimize your algorithm. The time limits are different for each language (some languages are slower than others), and you can see the limits for all the languages we support at our Environment page
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>Runtime error/Segmentation Fault.</em>
                <br/>Your code terminated unexpectedly. Did you overrun your array? Is your code trying to divide by zero?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>Abort Called.</em>
                <br/>Are you using too many resources? Maybe an array you created is too large and exceeds the memory limit, or an assert statement in your code is failing.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After you submit your code, hover your mouse cursor over the icon for each test case to view the verdicts and runtime for each test case your code was tested against</p>

            <h2>Can I share my code or solution?</h2>
            <p>Don't share hints/codes/strategy during a live contest â€” it violates the contest rules. It's always nice to help a fellow programmer learn, but posting spoilers during a competition makes it unfair. Once the contest ends, feel free to compare solutions with other coders and help others learn how it's done!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>I don't understand the problem statement, what should I do?</h2>
            <p>Read the statement a few more times, and check the Discussions tab to see if another coder posted something that will help you. If you still find it confusing, ask for help! If there's something in the problem statement you find misleading and think could be improved, submit feedback about the challenge and mention the specific sections you find confusing. Comments like "The challenge is confusing!" don't communicate enough information for people to know what you're talking about, so it's always best to be courteous and specific (e.g., "The second paragraph confuses me; is the graph directed or undirected?") when asking for help.</p>
